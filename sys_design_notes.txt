Step 1: Use cases and constraints
    Ask clarifying questions
    Understand / outline use cases
    State assumptions
    Back of envelope calculations?
Step 2: Create High Level Design (subsystem components)
Step 3: Design Core Components
    Ask: Which area to focus on first, etc? 
    Discuss Tradeoffs
    Clarify how much code to write
Step 4: Scale the design
    for web: load balancers, web server, reverse proxy
             cdn, master-slave data write server, read replicas,
             services, async jobs (with queues) -> 202, 302 redirect
